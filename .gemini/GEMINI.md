## Gemini Added Memories
- Focus strictly on one specific task at a time as requested by the user. Do not perform additional tasks (B or C) when asked for a specific task (A).
- MANDATORY WORKFLOW: Always run `npm run build` after finishing work to ensure no build errors.
- MANDATORY WORKFLOW: Before performing `git push`, ALWAYS ask the user: "Do you want me to change the version of cache clear before git push?" (referring to `APP_VERSION` in `src/main.tsx`).
